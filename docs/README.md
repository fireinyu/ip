## Introduction

- GRAVE WARNING: **All** software engineers may get replaced by *AI*.
- PSA: Are ***you*** an aspiring software engineer? Beating AI at software engineering seems more and more like a ***MYTH*** every day.

### URGENT ACTION YOU MUST DO THIS: EMBRACE THE MYTH

- Stare directly into ***THE MYTH***. Walk into it. Embrace it. Let it envelop you.
- **Start with THE MYTH** chatbot (this product btw).

## Set up

1. Ensure you have JDK 25. **Skip to step 6** if you already have JDK 25.
2. **Download JDK 25**, which includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), from the [Java downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java25). Choose the package for your operating system and processor architecture.
3. **Install JDK 25** using the [installation instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/25/install/) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
4. **Set** `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK installation directory, excluding its `bin` folder.
5. **Update** `PATH` to place `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` (Windows) or `$JAVA_HOME/bin` (macOS/Linux) before any existing Java entries.
6. **Verify the setup:** Open a new terminal or command prompt and run `java -version`. Confirm that the reported version starts with `25`.
7. Download The Myth from its [sparkling palace](https://github.com/fireinyu/ip/releases/tag/stable-latest).
8. **Summon The Myth** by executing `java -jar themyth.jar` in the directory containing *themyth.jar*.
